As you may know, I am now quite interested in the GitOps ecosphere and specifically the Argo Tooling suite since it was the one deployed at [WeMaintain](https://www.wemaintain.com/). I do not thing I will attend all of the meetings but It will be a good way to challenge my knowledge and believes about ArgoCD with ~the~ experts.

I will make sure to publish a short article summing up my impressions afterwards !
