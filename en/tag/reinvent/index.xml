And rightly so, not only was it the first but also today the one with the most advanced panoply of service offers. And yet, it continues to innovate year after year. Re:Invent is THE annual AWS meeting you should remember. The effervescence of energy, technology and announcement only makes you want to do one thing: try them!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunatly, the 2022 edition is already over&amp;hellip; but was not left out with its multitude of exclusive announcements! Some have particularly interested me and I will come back to them in the coming weeks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A very special thank you to Lionel Suss, now SRE manager at WeMaintain, for all the rich discussions we had during this week about this event!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
